# Monitoring GitHub Repositories with Grafana: A Complete Guide

## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced development environment, monitoring your code repositories is essential for maintaining efficiency and quality. GitHub is a powerful platform for version control and collaboration, but how do you visualize the performance of your repositories? Enter Grafana—a popular open-source dashboarding tool that can help you visualize your GitHub metrics in real time. This article outlines how to set up a monitoring dashboard using Grafana, Ansible, and Terraform to track GitHub repository metrics.

## Project Overview

The **Grafana Monitoring for GitHub** project provides a streamlined approach to monitor various metrics from GitHub repositories, including commit frequency, pull requests, and issues. By integrating Grafana with GitHub using a personal access token, we can create custom dashboards to visualize this data effectively. The project leverages **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning on AWS and **Ansible** for deployment and configuration.

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://example.com/architecture-diagram) *(Include a diagram if available)*

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Terraform**: Used to provision AWS resources, including EC2 instances and security groups.
- **Ansible**: Automates the installation and configuration of Grafana on the EC2 instance.
- **Grafana**: The dashboard tool used for visualizing GitHub metrics.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- An AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Terraform installed
- Ansible installed
- A GitHub personal access token with appropriate scopes (e.g., `repo`, `read:org`)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayman1902/Graphana-Monitoring-GitHub.git
cd Graphana-Monitoring-GitHub
```

### 2. Navigate to the Terraform Directory

Move to the Terraform directory:

```bash
cd Terraform
```

### 3. Initialize Terraform

Run the following command to initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

### 4. Apply the Terraform Configuration

Next, apply the Terraform configuration to provision AWS resources:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Review the resources that will be created and confirm the action.

### 5. Navigate to the Ansible Directory

Change to the Ansible directory:

```bash
cd ../Ansible
```

### 6. Run the Ansible Playbook

Run the Ansible playbook to install and configure Grafana:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini setup_grafana.yml
```

## Configuration

After setting up Grafana, you need to configure it to connect to your GitHub account:

1. **Update the `.env` file** with your GitHub personal access token.
2. Ensure the inventory file (`inventory.ini`) points to the correct EC2 instance.

## Accessing Grafana

Once the setup is complete, access Grafana by navigating to `http://<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>:3000` in your web browser. 

- **Default Login**:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin`

Make sure to change the password after the first login.

## Features

The Grafana Monitoring for GitHub project offers several key features:

- **Customizable Dashboard**: Easily create and customize your Grafana dashboard to visualize different metrics from your GitHub repositories.
- **Real-time Data**: Get real-time updates on your GitHub activities, including commits, pull requests, and issues.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for specific GitHub events, so you're notified of important activities.
- **Multi-Repository Support**: Monitor multiple GitHub repositories from a single Grafana instance.

## Known Issues

While the project is designed to be robust, users may encounter a few challenges:

- **API Rate Limits**: Monitoring multiple repositories may result in hitting GitHub API rate limits. Be aware of your usage.
- **Default Credentials**: It's crucial to change Grafana's default credentials immediately after setup to ensure security.
